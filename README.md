## Clustering:
-  Clustering is a technique in data mining in which, group of different data objects is classified as similar objects.
-  One group means a cluster of data. 
-  Data sets are divided into different groups in the cluster analysis, which is based on the similarity of the data. 
-  After the classification of data into various groups, a label is assigned to the group. It helps in adapting to the changes by doing the classification.
-  So, The process of dividing and storing data in these groups is known as <b><i>cluster analysis</i></b>.

## Cluster Analysis, Why?
  - As a data mining function, cluster analysis serves as a tool to gain insight into the distribution of data to observe characteristics of each cluster.
  - Makes Content Analysis Easy.
  - Market research, pattern recognition, data analysis, and image processing.
  - Identification of areas of similar land use in an earth observation database.
  - Classifying documents on the web for information discovery.
  - Outlier detection, such as detection of credit card fraud.
